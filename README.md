I'm Soumyadeep Basak, a first-year Computer Science Engineering student at the Academy of Technology. I have a passion for building innovative solutions, and I see coding and computers as my tools to bring ideas to life. My current skill set includes HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript, and I’m actively learning Node.js to expand my capabilities. 

One of the projects I’ve developed is a Python-based web scraper tool that automates the login and queue-monitoring process for Aternos, a popular Minecraft server hosting service. This tool simplifies the process for users by handling the repetitive tasks of logging in and queue-watching, allowing for a smoother experience.

Though I’m still early in my journey, I’m eager to take on more challenges, develop useful projects, and continuously grow as a developer. My goal is to leverage technology to create impactful solutions and contribute to the community.
